# Algorithmic Composer based on a Markov Chain

Bachelor thesis in IT Engineering focused on the design of a computational creativity system for the automatic generation of monophonic melodies using a Markov chain. It works thanks to an initial music information retrieval step, which consisted of the elaboration of more than 1200 scores taken by the "Nottingham Dataset" (Irish set of popular music). I analyzed the corpus using Python's library Music21 then I designed a Markov chain to emulate the human process called “combinatorial creativity”.

The initial music information retrieval phase was performed to apply a "restoration" of the Nottingham dataset converting all the songs from ABC format into the new standard MusicXML. After, I collected all the songs metadata and reorganized the corpus in a new database designed with MYSQL to ease its analysis in other research fields.
